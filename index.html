The city has a syncretic tradition of Islamic artisanship that underpins its religious tourism. Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) to the southeast of the state capital, Lucknow. It lies 121 kilometres (75 mi) downstream of Prayagraj, where the confluence with the Yamuna river is another major Hindu pilgrimage site.</p>

        <h1>History of Varanasi</h1>
        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">Varanasi, often referred to as Banaras or Kashi, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with a rich history that stretches back over 3,000 years. Located on the banks of the Ganges River in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi holds immense religious, cultural, and historical significance. It has been a center of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and later a prominent hub in the development of Indian art, culture, and spirituality. The city's name has changed over time—Kashi being its ancient name, Banaras during the medieval period, and Varanasi in the modern era—but its essence as a sacred city has remained constant..</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. Legend has it that Shiva established the city as his abode, and it is often referred to as the "City of Shiva." This connection to the divine gives Varanasi its status as a holy city, with Hindus believing that dying in Varanasi allows one's soul to escape the cycle of birth and rebirth and attain salvation (moksha).
        Archaeological evidence suggests that Varanasi was inhabited as early as the 11th century BCE. Ancient texts, including the Vedas, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana, mention the city, establishing its importance during the early Vedic period. During this time, Kashi was part of the larger Kashi Kingdom, which is described in the Mahajanapadas as one of the sixteen great kingdoms in northern India.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag paratextbig">Vishwanath Temple</p><br>
        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most revered temples in India, dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, which are considered the holiest shrines of Shiva. Varanasi, also known as Kashi, is believed to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is regarded as a spiritual center for Hindus. The temple's significance lies not only in its religious importance but also in its rich history, which has withstood centuries of upheaval and change.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">The temple has a deep historical significance. The original Vishwanath Temple is believed to have existed since ancient times, though it faced multiple destructions throughout history. The most notable destruction occurred in the 17th century, when Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb demolished the temple and constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site. Despite these challenges, the temple was eventually rebuilt. The current structure was constructed in 1780 by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The temple complex, however, has continued to evolve over time, with various kings and devotees contributing to its maintenance and expansion.
                One of the most significant contributions to the temple was made by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of Punjab, who donated gold to plate the temple’s domes in the early 19th century. The golden domes are one of the most striking features of the temple today, giving it a distinct identity among Hindu places of worship. The architecture of the temple follows the Nagara style, which is typical of North Indian temple architecture, with its tall spires and intricate carvings.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">The Ganga Ghats of Varanasi are a series of sacred steps leading down to the banks of the River Ganga. They are integral to the city’s spiritual and cultural life, serving as places of worship, meditation, and daily activities. There are over 80 ghats along the river, each with its own unique history and significance.In addition to their spiritual significance, the Ganga Ghats of Varanasi are deeply embedded in the city’s cultural and social life. They are not only places of worship but also hubs of art, music, and learning. The ghats have inspired poets, writers, and artists for centuries, making them a center for creative expression.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">One of the most famous ghats is the Dashashwamedh Ghat, believed to be where Lord Brahma performed a grand sacrifice. It is known for its evening Ganga Aarti, a spiritual ceremony involving fire, music, and prayers, attracting thousands of devotees and tourists daily. Another significant ghat is the Manikarnika Ghat, which is the main cremation ghat, symbolizing the Hindu belief in life, death, and the attainment of moksha (liberation).Other notable ghats include the Assi Ghat, popular for early morning yoga and religious rituals, and the Harishchandra Ghat, another cremation site. These ghats serve as the heart of Varanasi, blending spirituality with daily life, where pilgrims come to bathe in the sacred Ganga, offer prayers, and perform rituals, making the ghats an inseparable part of the city’s essence.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag paratextbig">Sarnath</p><br>
        <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">Sarnath, located about 10 kilometers northeast of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the world. It holds deep historical and spiritual significance, as it is the place where Gautama Buddha delivered his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. This pivotal moment, known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (Turning of the Wheel of Dharma), marks the beginning of Buddhism as a major world religion. In this sermon, Buddha introduced the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, laying the foundation for his teachings on overcoming suffering and attaining nirvana.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="sectionsubtag paratextsmall">Sarnath's significance grew during the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. A devout follower of Buddhism, Ashoka visited Sarnath and erected many monuments, including the Ashoka Pillar, which stands as a symbol of India's rich Buddhist heritage. The lion capital atop the pillar was later adopted as the national emblem of India. Ashoka also built stupas and monasteries, transforming Sarnath into a flourishing center of Buddhist learning and culture. The Dhamek Stupa, one of the most prominent structures in Sarnath, marks the exact spot where Buddha gave his first sermon.

                Over the centuries, Sarnath continued to thrive as a major hub for Buddhist scholars and monks. However, it faced decline after the 12th century due to invasions and the spread of other religions in India. Despite this, its ruins and monuments remain an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists from around the world</p>
